# Lost-boarding-pass-solution

  On a sold-out flight, 100 people line up to board the plane. The first passenger in the line has lost his boarding pass but was allowed in, regardless. He takes a random seat. Each subsequent passenger takes his or her assigned seat if available, or a random unoccupied seat, otherwise. What is the probability that the last passenger to board the plane finds his seat unoccupied?
